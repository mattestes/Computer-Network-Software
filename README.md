Carlos - Created the barebones of the project, created the client/server and the terminal/unix shell for this project. Was able to create the functionality of joining, and leaving a certain chat room process, and send a message to connected processes.


### How to run

clone this repo

cd .\Computer-Network-Software\

must have python (python3 preferred)

`python ./chat.py <desired port number, this is the port number you will be hosting your chat room>`

for example

`python ./chat.py 5656`

1) run `help` in the shell to get a list of all commands

run `help <command>` to read the documentation of that command

2) run `myip` to see the ip of your machine

3) run `myport` to see the port you have chosen for your chatroom

4) run `connect <remote_ip> <remote_port>` to connect to a different user's chatroom

5) run `list` to see the all the connections the process if part of

6) run `terminate <connection_id>` to terminate connection to a certain host (connection_id is from the list command)

7) run `send <message> <connection_id>` to send a message to a certain host (connection_id is from the list commands)
